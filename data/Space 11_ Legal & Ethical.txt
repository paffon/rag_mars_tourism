*Legal & Ethical*
What are the legal implications of space travel?
Space travel is governed by a complex framework of international treaties, national laws, and company regulations. Passengers must adhere to these rules, which cover aspects such as liability, resource utilization, and conduct in space. We provide comprehensive legal briefings during pre-trip training.  
What are the ethical considerations?
We are committed to ethical space exploration, including responsible resource utilization, environmental protection, and cultural sensitivity. We engage in ongoing dialogue with experts and stakeholders to address ethical concerns. We also have an ethics board that reviews all of our practices.
What are the terms of liability?
Our terms of liability are clearly outlined in the booking agreement. These terms address potential risks and responsibilities, including medical emergencies, equipment malfunctions, and unforeseen events. We recommend that passengers obtain travel insurance to cover potential liabilities.
What are the rules regarding extraterrestrial resources?
The utilization of extraterrestrial resources is governed by international agreements, such as the Outer Space Treaty. We adhere to these regulations and prioritize sustainable resource management. We also believe that the resources of Mars should be used for the benefit of all humanity.
