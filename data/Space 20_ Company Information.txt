What is the company's history?
We started in a garage, like all the best space-faring companies, except ours was a really, *really* big garage.

Who are the founders and key personnel?
A ragtag team of dreamers, engineers, and a suspiciously intelligent hamster named Sparky, who handles our navigation.

Adventure, snacks, and not getting eaten by Martian sand worms (we think).

To open a Martian resort with an all-you-can-eat asteroid buffet.

We read them while floating in zero-g, which makes everything sound hilarious.
